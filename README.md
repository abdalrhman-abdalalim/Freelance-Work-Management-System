# Freelance Work Management System (FWMS)

FWMS is a **hands-on workshop project** designed to help developers learn how to **collaborate effectively on a real-world product** using a **clear architecture, well-defined responsibilities, and structured workflows**.

The project simulates a production-ready system while focusing on **organization, clean separation of concerns, and teamwork** rather than just feature implementation.

- Work together using a **shared product vision**
- Understand how **requirements translate into architecture**
- Practice **clean, scalable project structure**
- Learn **role-based access control** in real applications
- Build features incrementally using **Agile principles**

> FWMS is not just a task management app — it is a **collaborative learning environment**.
